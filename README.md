- 👋 Hi, I’m @PawelWozniak
- 👀 I’m a Salesforce Developer who can work on difficult topics like audits, health checks, remediation planning, data discrepancy issues, deployment issues, performance optimization, tracking hard to find bugs, failing tests, and flows. Any difficult topics that others don't want to touch or are afraid of.
